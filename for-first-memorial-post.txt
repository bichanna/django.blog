Hi, I am bichanna, who owns this website.
I'm a teenage math lover from Japan living in the U.S. one and a half years (This post is written in February 2021).
I came up with creating my own website (I actually made this website on my own if you believe it or not!) about math for both native English speakers and Japanese speakers because I couldn't remember all of English math words.

I wish you good luck with math!
